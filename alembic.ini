# Alembic Configuration File
#
# This is the main configuration file for Alembic, a database migration tool used with SQLAlchemy.
# It controls how database migrations are handled, including:
# - Where migration scripts are stored
# - Database connection settings
# - Logging configuration
#
# Key sections:
# [alembic] - Core settings for migrations
# [loggers], [handlers], [formatters] - Python logging configuration

[alembic]
# Location of migration scripts
script_location = backend/migrations

# Database connection URL - Should be overridden by environment variable
sqlalchemy.url = driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname
